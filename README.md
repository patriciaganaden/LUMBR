# LUMBR 
#### Land Use. Monitor. Boundaries. Reforestation. 

Lumbr is a web application that enables over-laying of thematic maps such as rainfall, temperature, elevation, forest cover and watershed boundaries. It encourages site-specific activities on sustainability and resilience of the watershed ecosystem and its socio-cultural aspect. It allows a supervisor to draw the boundary upon classified lands on his/her reforestation or livelihood projects. Hired stewards will monitor the area and updates will be sent to the supervisor on a regular basis.
